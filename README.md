# MassiveMIMO-Beanforming
It is a simple simulation tools of Array antenna beamforming based on Matlab GUI. Aiming to help Beamforming beginers quickly start arrays Antenna learing.

#### quick start
##### environment:Matlab 2020a +
1. open matlab and change the directory to `/matlab_Gui`
2. `Menu_Seletor.fig` is the starter of the whole program.


#### There are four selection:
+ Regular Array pattern
+ Arbitary Array pattern
+ Beamforming By Steering Vevtor
+ Beamforming by codebook (two implemented by other papers, one designed by myself)
